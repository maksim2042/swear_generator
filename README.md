I was watching a couple Scottish guys yelling at each other on Facebook and thought... Why does Scottish cursing sound so damn good? They seem to string almost random concepts together and it just makes sense!

Then, I found a clue in the phonetic construction of the words.

  shitgibbon
  fuckmoppet
  cockblaster

All of these words have one thing in common: 1st part is a 1-syllable is a description of a bodily function/organ, and the second part is a 2-syllable word with an accent on first syllable.
The second part is usually a gerund verb that may contain another profanity as its first syllable:

  ferret-wearing shitgibbon
  cocksucking fuckmoppet
  ballbusting dickhammer

Now all that remained is to implenent a generator.

* We start by filtering a pronounciation dictionary to get us 2-syllable words with accent on 1st syllable, and gerund verbs
* Set of profanities is pre-written. Please add more as you see unfit
* Words are randomly generated by combining a random profanity with a random gerund, and another random profanity with a 2-syllable noun. 

Results are not always usable, but will produce an occasional chuckle among these easily impressed
